    Cost management revolves around reducing, estimating, containing and avoiding costs using various different methods (Drury, 2008) (Groth and Kinney, 1994). 
    Reducing costs is done through seeking to lower both fixed and variable costs associated with an activity. 

    Cost management is often ignored by managers instead they are in favour of increasing sales. Most of the time excessive costs can be an underlying problem and cost control can be very effective in creating larger profits, “a dollar of cost savings goes directly to the bottom line, 
    while a dollar increase in sales may in fact produce a loss to the bottom line” (Reider, 2011)
